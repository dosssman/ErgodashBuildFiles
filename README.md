# ErgoDash Split MechanicalKeyboard Build (Switch hotswap, backlight and LED Underglow files)

See write up at [https://dosssman.github.io/projects/ergodash-build/](https://dosssman.github.io/projects/ergodash-build/).

The layout file is in JSON format and titled `dosssman_layout.json`.
See the write up above, [Firmware Flash Notes](https://dosssman.github.io/projects/ergodash-build/#firmware-flash-notes) for the flasing procedure used.

The QMK Firmware files used are in [this QMK Firmware Fork], under the `qmk_firmware/keyboards/ergodash/rev1/keymaps/dosssman`

The files for the laser cut custom acrylic cases with tenting support are those in the following [repository](https://github.com/clomie/ergodash-tilting-tenting-case).

Other files are just pictures and XCF resources used for mock design before ordering switches, backlight LED and keycaps.
